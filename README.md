## Live version of this site at [ellul.ca](https://ellul.ca)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i && npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder and then pushes the `build` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.<br>

The `gh-pages` branch is setup to serve this website as a Github Pages project page.

Designed and programmed by Jason Ellul.
